# John-Lemon-Final
-I am alone in this assignment, my name is David
-The modifications I made to the game are simple, I made it so John moves faster on the press of the shift key and added a timer that when finished counting down it acts like I got caught. I also made some modifications to the steps so that they play faster whenever I speed up and made it so both the caught and exit end game causes resets.
